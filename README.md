# Covid_19_in_R
Global statistics and impact of policy on Covid_19 globally

Using R, this project aims to understand the global trends for Covid-19 up to end July 2020, specifically specific countries (UK, USA, Italy, Switzerland).  
A secondary aim is to graphically plot the impact of policy, namely testing policy, hospital beds and transport.

The specific aims are:-

1. Global mortality rate to end July 2020
2. Confirmed cases
3. Confirmed cases as a fraction of cases
4. Confirmed cases as a fraction of the total population
5. UK fatalities
6. Mortality rate in USA, Italy and Switzerland (Switzerland is used to compare as the virus is generally less severe)
7. Mortality rate by region in USA
8. Mortality rate by region in Italy and Switzerland
9. Mortality rate and changes in testing policy
10. Mortality rate and availability of hospital beds
11. Impact_transport_policy_on_confirmed_to_tested_and_deaths_to_confirmed

Many thanks to the many R_Bloggers, members of R_London, Githubers, Kagglers and Youtubers who have provided me with so much guidance and inspiration.

Finally, many thanks to the Coursera course on Contact Tracing the Coronovirus (run by John Hopkins University) which I took and passed (96%)
